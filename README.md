# Trash-Master
This repo contains the code for the android application which was used on the IoT based Project of Trash-Master.

Trash Master is an IoT based smart dustbin which encourages the user to put garbage in the bin. 
Incentives to the users will be given in the form of virtual points based on the weight of the trash they are putting in the bin.
These points can then later be redeemed for vouchers and gifts.

This project is developed for the competition IIT Pals Innowah conducted by IIT Madras 

## This is one of the Top 20 Projects from the overall of 100+ projects submitted for the competition
